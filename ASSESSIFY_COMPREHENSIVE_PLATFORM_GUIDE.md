## 💰 REVENUE MODEL

### How Assessify Makes Money

#### 1. **Submission Fee Revenue** (Primary Revenue Stream)

**Model:**
- Assignment/Test Submission: ₦200 per submission
- AI Assignment Writer: ₦100 per submission
- Fees apply to all students (non-configurable, standardized)
- Fee goes to: Platform (50%), Lecturer (35%), Partner (15% if lecturer was referred by a partner)
- Paid via Paystack (debit card, bank transfer, etc.)

**Revenue Calculation:**
```
Per Institution:
- Average students: 5,000
- Average submissions/year: 20 per student
- Average fee: ₦200

Annual Submission Revenue:
5,000 students × 20 submissions × ₦200 = ₦20M total revenue

Platform share (50%): ₦10M/year per institution

Scaling:
50 institutions × ₦10M = ₦500M/year (Year 1 Target)
```

**Example Institution Economics:**
```
Medium University (2,000 students)
- 20 courses per semester
- ~200 assignments per semester
- Average submission: 150 per assignment
- Submission fee: ₦200 per submission

Per Semester:
200 assignments × 150 submissions × ₦200 = ₦6M

Revenue Split (per transaction):
- Platform (50%): ₦3M → Used for operations, development, support
- Lecturers (35%): ₦2.1M → Distributed as commission
- Partners (15%): ₦0.9M → Distributed to referring partners (if applicable)

Annual (2 semesters):
- Platform: ₦6M
- Lecturers: ₦4.2M
- Partners: ₦1.8M
- TOTAL: ₦12M per institution

Assessify Share (50%): ₦6M per institution per year
```

#### 2. **Premium Features** (Secondary Revenue Stream)

**Coming Soon Features:**
- Advanced Analytics (₦2,500 - ₦10,000/semester)
- Custom Integrations (₦5,000 - ₦50,000 one-time)
- White-label Solution (₦50,000 - ₦250,000/year)
- API Access (₦5,000 - ₦25,000/month)
- Priority Support (₦2,500/month)

#### 3. **Partner (Lecturer Referrer) Commissions** (Referral Revenue)

**Model:**
- Partners earn 15% commission on every submission from each lecturer they refer
- Goes directly to partner wallet based on referred lecturer performance
- Partner commission is applied per transaction

**Partner Commission Calculation:**
```
Example:
- Partner refers 5 lecturers
- Each lecturer has ~350 students across multiple levels
- Each lecturer generates ~1,400 submissions/month
- Submission fee: ₦200
- Partner commission: 15% = ₦30 per submission

Monthly Commission Per Lecturer:
1,400 submissions × ₦30 = ₦42,000/month per referred lecturer

Total Partner Income (5 lecturers):
5 × ₦42,000 = ₦210,000/month = ₦2.52M/year
```

#### 4. **Institutional Licensing** (B2B Revenue - Future)

**Tiered Pricing for Direct Enterprise Institutions:**
```
Tier 1 (Small Institute): 100-500 students
- Fee: ₦25,000 - ₦50,000/year
- Features: Basic analytics, priority support

Tier 2 (Medium Institution): 500-2,000 students
- Fee: ₦100,000 - ₦250,000/year
- Features: Advanced analytics, API access

Tier 3 (Large University): 2,000+ students

- Features: Custom integrations, white-label option, dedicated support

Enterprise: Custom pricing
- Dedicated account manager
- Custom integrations
- White-label platform
- SSO integration
- Custom SLA
```

#### 5. **Data Analytics & Insights** (Future Revenue)

**Models:**
- Anonymized aggregated data sold to EdTech companies
- Market research insights sold to publishers
- Student success predictions (help students/institutions plan)

### Revenue Waterfall (Example)

```
YEAR 1 TARGET: Realistic Conservative Projections

50 INSTITUTIONS ONBOARDED
├─ Faculty of Sciences (5 institutions, 2,000 students each)
├─ Faculty of Social Sciences (10 institutions, 1,500 students each)
├─ Faculty of Education (10 institutions, 1,200 students each)
├─ Teaching Centers (15 centers, 300 students each)
└─ Corporate Training (10 programs, 200 students each)

TOTAL: ~100,000 Active Students (conservative)

ANNUAL SUBMISSION VOLUME:
100,000 students × 15 submissions/year = 1.5M submissions

REVENUE CALCULATION:
1.5M submissions × ₦200 per submission = ₦300M total

Assessify Share (50%): ₦150M / 12 = ₦12.5M/month
                                     ₦150M/year

OPERATING COSTS (Estimated):
- Cloud Infrastructure (Supabase): ₦1M/month = ₦12M/year
- AI API Costs (Claude, Gemini): ₦5M/month = ₦60M/year
- Staff (5-8 people): ₦6M/month = ₦72M/year
- Marketing/Sales: ₦2M/month = ₦24M/year
- Support/Operations: ₦1M/month = ₦12M/year
- Contingency (10%): ₦1M/month = ₦12M/year

TOTAL OPERATING COSTS: ₦16M/month = ₦192M/year (but we break even earlier)

PROFITABILITY:
Revenue: ₦150M
Costs: ₦120M (conservative, with staff)
Gross Profit: ₦30M (20% margin*)
(*Lower margin in Year 1 due to scaling investments; improves to 60% by Year 2)

YEAR 2-3 PROJECTIONS:
- Scale to 200+ institutions
- Grow to 1M+ students
- Add premium features (₦20M-₦50M)
- Improve margins (reduce cost per submission via automation)
- Projected Year 3 Revenue: ₦1.5B+
- Projected Year 3 Profit: ₦900M+ (60% margin)
```

### Revenue Sharing Breakdown

**Per Transaction:**
```
Student submits assignment for ₦200

Breakdown:
1. Platform Operations (50%): ₦100
   - Platform maintenance: ₦45
   - AI API costs (Claude): ₦35
   - Infrastructure (servers): ₦15
   - Support & development: ₦5

2. Lecturer/Instructor (35%): ₦70
   - Goes directly to instructor wallet
   - Can be withdrawn or reinvested

3. Partner/Referrer (15%): ₦30 (if applicable)
   - Goes to partner that referred this lecturer
   - ₦0 if no partner involved
   - In which case: Lecturer gets ₦85 (add 15% back)

Alternative Split (if partner involved):
- Platform: ₦100 (50%) → Operations
- Lecturer: ₦60 (30%) → Instructor
- Partner: ₦40 (20%) → Referral source
TOTAL: ₦200
```
